## Robotics #001 | Navigation and Motion Profiling

One popular method of getting into robotics, especially at a young age, is through participation in academic robotics competitions like VEX Robotics Competition and First Robotics Competition (FRC). These programs provide students with the tools to build robots specialized to perform certain competition-specific tasks, greatly exposing them to core hardware and software techniques that stay relevant well beyond high school or even college.

Alongside developing skills in manufacturing and physical assembly, students are often involved in building complex embedded programs. Of particular interest to me is the dynamic systems and control algorithms involved at the highest levels of competition, specifically in the subjects of robot localization, navigation, and motion profiling.
