## Learning to Learn

It makes sense that a blog centered on learning about new DIY technologies ought to have an entry about learning itself. Readers may find this ironic since learning -- the method by which a person improves their skills -- is a skill of itself. It takes effort to learn how to learn.

According to ongoing research, the most widely accepted way to effectively and efficiently learn anything is through the use of active recall, spaced repetition, and elaborative interrogation. This is in contrast to the previously accepted method of learning by repetition or increased exposure. It is not enough to merely reread a body of text to "burn a topic into memory". Effortful mastery of a subject comes from multimodal interaction with the subject matter -- both varying in the method of learning and in the time between learning sessions.

Active recall most often involves testing and self-assessment to demonstrate the ability to explain a subject from memory. This provides the dual benefit of improving neural connections relating to the subject and of identifying knowledge gaps and future areas of improvement surrounding the subject.

Spaced repetition is the deliberate delaying of consecutive recall sessions. This has been shown to more effectively develop durable memory of a subject as compared to strategies like cramming which emphasize hurried rereading within a short timeframe.

Elaborative interrogation is connecting learned material to other information to develop denser connections for a given topic. The diversity of connections further solidifies understanding and also helps with identifying further knowledge gaps or opportunities for continued growth. Elaborative interrogation is asking "why" questions which help to connect new findings with previously understood concepts.

To facilitate learning, I plan to create a suite of software integrated with my ecosystem of devices that uses the principles of active recall, spaced repetition, and elaborative interrogation. The software will be frictionless yet ubiquitous, encouraging habit formation while sticking to the proven learning strategies described above.
